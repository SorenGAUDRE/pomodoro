# Pomodoro Timer

This is a **Pomodoro Timer** web application, which helps users manage their work and break intervals efficiently using the Pomodoro Technique. The application is fully customizable and saves the user's preferences (work and break durations) using **Local Storage**, so these settings persist across sessions.
